# Packer script files
These script files are used by packer to create the vms. The scripts are usually provided via the ```floppy_files``` instruction in the packer file as follows - the can be explicitly specified or via wildcard *

```"floppy_files": [
   "../scripts/*"
],

Some of the windows scripts are provided from other, I will add references in the files directly to reflect that.
